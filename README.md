Simple, hardened multi-agent safety setup for any git repo.

## Why this tool exists

If you run multiple agents at the same time, it is easy to get collisions:
two agents editing the same files, unsafe deletes, broken branch flow, or
confusing ownership.

`musafety` adds strict guardrails so parallel agent work stays safe and predictable.

![Multi-agent dashboard example](docs/images/dashboard-multi-agent.png)

The dashboard above is the exact kind of parallel workflow this tool is built for.

It also includes an OpenSpec planning scaffold script so plan-mode workspaces
can be bootstrapped consistently across repos.

## Install

```sh
npm i -g musafety
```

Package page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/musafety

## Security + maintenance posture

- CI matrix on Node 18/20/22 (`npm test`, `node --check`, `npm pack --dry-run`)
- trusted publishing workflow uses `npm publish --provenance` in GitHub Actions
- OpenSSF Scorecard workflow and weekly Dependabot for GitHub Actions
- Dedicated security disclosure policy in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)

- [oh-my-codex (OMX)](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex)
- [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)

## Fast setup (recommended)

```sh
# inside your repo
musafety setup
```

That one command runs:

1. detects whether OMX/OpenSpec are already globally installed,
2. asks strict Y/N approval only if something is missing,
3. installs guardrail scripts/hooks,
4. repairs common safety problems,
5. installs local Codex + Claude musafety helper skill files if missing,
6. scans and reports final status.

## AI helper skills installed by setup/doctor

`musafety setup` and `musafety doctor` also ensure these local helper files exist:

- Codex skill: `.codex/skills/musafety/SKILL.md`
- Claude command: `.claude/commands/musafety.md` (use as `/musafety`)

## Scorecard report generation

Create/update markdown reports from OpenSSF Scorecard JSON:

```sh
musafety report scorecard --repo github.com/recodeecom/multiagent-safety
```

By default this writes:

- `docs/reports/openssf-scorecard-baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `docs/reports/openssf-scorecard-remediation-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Workflow protocol screenshots

### 1) Start isolated agent branch/worktree

### 2) Lock claim + deletion guard protocol

![musafety lock and delete guard screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recodeecom/multiagent-safety/main/docs/images/workflow-lock-guard.svg)

### 3) Multi-agent branch visibility (IDE/source control style)

## Copy prompt for your AI (Codex / Claude)

```sh
musafety copy-prompt
```

This prints a ready-to-paste prompt.

If you only want executable commands (without explanatory text):

```sh

```

Example output:

```sh
npm i -g musafety
musafety setup
musafety doctor
bash scripts/codex-agent.sh "task" "agent-name"
bash scripts/agent-branch-start.sh "task" "agent-name"
python3 scripts/agent-file-locks.py claim --branch "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" <file...>
bash scripts/agent-branch-finish.sh --branch "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
bash scripts/openspec/init-plan-workspace.sh "<plan-slug>"
musafety protect add release staging
musafety sync --check
musafety sync
```

Full checklist output:

```text
Use this exact checklist to setup multi-agent safety in this repository for Codex or Claude.

1) Install (if missing):
   npm i -g musafety

2) Bootstrap safety in this repo:
   musafety setup

   - Setup detects global OMX/OpenSpec first.
   - If one is missing and setup asks for approval, reply explicitly:
     - y = run: npm i -g oh-my-codex @fission-ai/openspec (missing ones only)
     - n = skip global installs

3) If setup reports warnings/errors, repair + re-check:
   musafety doctor

4) Confirm next safe agent workflow commands:
   bash scripts/codex-agent.sh "task" "agent-name"
   bash scripts/agent-branch-start.sh "task" "agent-name"
   python3 scripts/agent-file-locks.py claim --branch "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" <file...>
   bash scripts/agent-branch-finish.sh --branch "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"

5) Optional: create OpenSpec planning workspace:
   bash scripts/openspec/init-plan-workspace.sh "<plan-slug>"

6) Optional: protect extra branches:
   musafety protect add release staging

7) Optional: sync your current agent branch with latest dev:
   musafety sync --check
   musafety sync
```

## Basic commands

```sh
musafety status [--target <path>] [--json]
musafety setup [--target <path>] [--dry-run] [--yes-global-install|--no-global-install] [--no-gitignore]
musafety doctor [--target <path>] [--dry-run] [--json] [--keep-stale-locks] [--no-gitignore]
musafety copy-prompt
musafety copy-commands
musafety protect list [--target <path>]
musafety protect add <branch...> [--target <path>]
musafety protect remove <branch...> [--target <path>]
musafety protect set <branch...> [--target <path>]
musafety protect reset [--target <path>]
musafety sync --check [--target <path>] [--base <branch>] [--json]
musafety sync [--target <path>] [--base <branch>] [--strategy rebase|merge] [--ff-only]
musafety report scorecard [--target <path>] [--repo github.com/<owner>/<repo>] [--scorecard-json <file>] [--output-dir <path>] [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
bash scripts/agent-worktree-prune.sh --base dev   # manual stale worktree cleanup
bash scripts/openspec/init-plan-workspace.sh <plan-slug>   # optional OpenSpec plan scaffold
```

No command defaults to `musafety status` (non-mutating health/status view).
`musafety status` reports CLI/runtime info, global OMX/OpenSpec service status, and repo safety service state.
When run in an interactive terminal, default `musafety` checks npm for a newer version first
and asks `[y/N]` whether to update immediately (default is `N`).

- Interactive setup: prompts for Y/N approval before global OMX/OpenSpec install.
- Interactive prompt is strict (`[y/n]`) and waits for explicit answer.
- Non-interactive setup: skips global installs by default; use `--yes-global-install` to force.

## Advanced commands

```sh
musafety install [--target <path>] [--force] [--skip-agents] [--skip-package-json] [--no-gitignore] [--dry-run]
musafety fix [--target <path>] [--dry-run] [--keep-stale-locks] [--no-gitignore]
musafety scan [--target <path>] [--json]
musafety report help
```

## Keep agent branches synced with dev

Use sync checks before finishing agent branches:

```sh
musafety sync --check
musafety sync
```

Defaults:

- base branch: `dev` (or `multiagent.baseBranch`)
- strategy: `rebase` (or `multiagent.sync.strategy`)

Useful variants:

```sh
musafety sync --strategy merge
musafety sync --all-agent-branches --check
```

By default, `agent-branch-finish.sh` also blocks finishing when your branch is behind `origin/<base>` and points to `musafety sync`.

Optional pre-commit behind-threshold gate (off by default):

```sh
git config multiagent.sync.requireBeforeCommit true
git config multiagent.sync.maxBehindCommits 0
```

With that enabled, agent-branch commits are blocked if the branch is behind `origin/<base>` by more than the configured threshold.

## Configure protected branches

Default protected branches are:

- `dev`
- `main`
- `master`

You can manage additional protected branches via CLI:

```sh
musafety protect list
musafety protect add release staging
musafety protect remove dev
musafety protect set main release hotfix
musafety protect reset
```

Configuration is stored in local git config key:

```text
multiagent.protectedBranches
```

## What is protected

- direct commits to protected branches (defaults: `dev`, `main`, `master`; configurable via `musafety protect ...`)
- protected-branch commits are blocked regardless of commit client (including VS Code Source Control)
- Codex-session commits on non-`agent/*` branches are blocked by default (`multiagent.codexRequireAgentBranch=true`)
- overlapping file ownership between agents
- unapproved deletions of claimed files
- risky stale/missing lock state
- accidental loss of critical guardrail files
- in-place branch bootstrap requires explicit opt-in (`--in-place --allow-in-place`)
- setup also writes a managed `.gitignore` block so generated musafety scripts/hooks stay out of normal git status noise by default
  - includes `oh-my-codex/` by default to keep local OMX source clones out of repo status
  - pass `--no-gitignore` if you want to keep tracking these files in git

## Files it installs

```text
scripts/agent-branch-start.sh
scripts/agent-branch-finish.sh
scripts/codex-agent.sh
scripts/agent-worktree-prune.sh
scripts/agent-file-locks.py
scripts/install-agent-git-hooks.sh
scripts/openspec/init-plan-workspace.sh
.githooks/pre-commit
.codex/skills/musafety/SKILL.md
.claude/commands/musafety.md
.omx/state/agent-file-locks.json
```

If `package.json` exists, it also adds helper scripts (`agent:*`).

## Local development

```sh
npm test
node --check bin/multiagent-safety.js
npm pack --dry-run
```
