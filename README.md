## `02` &nbsp;The problem

![Parallel agents colliding in the same files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recodeee/gitguardex/main/docs/images/problem-agent-collision.svg)

I was running ~30 Codex agents in parallel and hit a wall: they kept
working on the same files at the same time — especially tests — and
started overwriting or deleting each other's changes. More agents meant
**less** forward progress, not more.

| before · parallel collisions | after · isolated lanes + file locks |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-01` → `src/auth/login.ts` · ⚠ clash | `codex-01` → `agent/codex/login-refactor` · ● owned |
| `codex-02` → `src/auth/login.ts` · ⚠ clash | `codex-02` → `agent/codex/login-tests` · ● owned |
| `codex-03` → `test/auth.spec.ts` · ⚠ clash | `codex-03` → `agent/codex/session-guard` · ● owned |
| `claude-a` → `test/auth.spec.ts` · ⚠ clash | `claude-a` → `agent/claude/token-rotation` · ● owned |
| `codex-04` → `src/auth/session.ts` · ◌ stalled | `human` → `main` (protected) · ● clean |

---

## `03` &nbsp;What it does

- **Isolated `agent/*` branch + worktree per task.** Agents never share a
  working directory. Your visible local branch never changes mid-run.
- **Explicit file lock claiming.** An agent declares the files it's
  editing before it edits them. Claimed files can't be clobbered by
  another lane.
- **Deletion guard.** Claimed files can't be removed by another agent —
  no more ghost-deleted tests between runs.
- **Protected-base safety.** `main`, `dev`, `master` are blocked by
  default. Agents must go through PRs.
- **Auto-merges agent configs.** `oh-my-codex`, `oh-my-claudecode`,
  caveman mode, and OpenSpec all get applied automatically per worktree.
- **Repair / doctor flow.** When drift happens (and it will), `gx doctor`
  gets you back to a clean, verified state.
- **Auto-finish on session exit.** Codex exits → Guardex commits sandbox
  changes, syncs against base, retries once if base moved, and opens a PR.
- **Monorepo + nested repos.** Setup walks into every nested `.git`.
  Submodules and sandboxes are skipped automatically.

---

## `04` &nbsp;Daily workflow

Per new agent task — four steps, every time:

| `01` start isolated lane | `02` claim files | `03` implement + verify | `04` finish |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spawns `agent/role/task` branch + its own worktree. | Declare what you're touching. Other agents are blocked from these paths. | Run tests inside the sandbox — not against the live base branch. | Commit, push, open PR, wait for merge, prune the sandbox. |

```bash
# 1) start isolated branch/worktree
gx branch start "task-name" "agent-name"

# 2) claim the files you're going to touch
gx locks claim --branch "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" <file...>

# 3) implement + verify
npm test

# 4) finish — commit + push + PR + merge + cleanup
gx branch finish --branch "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" \
    --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup
```

> [!TIP]
> Launching Codex through Guardex runs **finish automatically** when the
> session exits — auto-commits, retries once if the base moved mid-run,
> then pushes and opens the PR.

## `05` &nbsp;What `gx` shows first

Before you branch, repair, or start agents, run plain `gx`. It gives you
a one-screen status for the CLI, global helpers, repo safety service,
current repo path, and active branch.

```text
$ gx

  ▮▮  gitguardex   v7.0.31
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  repo      /Users/you/code/your-repo
  branch    agent/codex/login-refactor  (sandbox of main)
  hooks     ● installed   pre-commit · pre-push · post-merge
  locks     ● 4 files claimed   by 3 agents
  service   ● running      review-bot · cleanup

  COMPANIONS
  ● oh-my-codex                    active
  ● oh-my-claude-sisyphus          active
  ● @fission-ai/openspec           active
  ● cavemem                        active
  ● cavekit                        optional · not installed
  ● gh                             authenticated

  NEXT   › gx branch start "task" "agent"
         › gx doctor   (if anything drifts)
```

Compact by default in a TTY. Pass `--verbose` for the full services
list and grouped help tree, or set `GUARDEX_COMPACT_STATUS=1` to force
the compact layout everywhere.

## `06` &nbsp;How `AGENTS.md` is handled

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GitGuardex never overwrites your guidance.** Only content between
> these markers is managed:
> `<!-- multiagent-safety:START --> … <!-- multiagent-safety:END -->`.
> Everything outside that block is preserved byte-for-byte.

| Your repo has… | `gx setup` / `gx doctor` does… |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` **with** markers | Refreshes **only** the managed block. |
| `AGENTS.md` **without** markers | Appends the managed block to the end. |
| No `AGENTS.md` | Creates it with the managed block. |
| A root `CLAUDE.md` | Leaves it alone. |

---

## `07` &nbsp;Commands

### Core

| command | does |
| --- | --- |
| `gx status` | Health check (the default when you type `gx`). |
| `gx status --strict` | Exit non-zero on findings. |
| `gx setup` | Full bootstrap. |
| `gx setup --repair` | Repair only. |
| `gx setup --install-only` | Scaffold templates, skip global installs. |
| `gx doctor` | Repair + verify (auto-sandboxes on protected main). |

### Lifecycle

| command | does |
| --- | --- |
| `gx finish --all` | Commit + PR + merge every ready `agent/*` branch. |
| `gx cleanup` | Prune merged / stale branches and worktrees. |
| `gx sync` | Sync current agent branch against base. |
| `gx release` | Update the GitHub release from README notes. |

### Protected branches

```bash
gx protect list
gx protect add release staging
gx protect remove release
gx protect set main release hotfix
gx protect reset   # back to: dev · main · master
```

---

## `08` &nbsp;v6 → v7 migration

Five commands were consolidated into flags. Old names still work and
print a deprecation notice; they'll be removed in v8.

| v6 | v7 |
| --- | --- |
| `gx init` | `gx setup` |
| `gx install` | `gx setup --install-only` |
| `gx fix` | `gx setup --repair` |
| `gx scan` | `gx status --strict` |
| `gx copy-prompt` | `gx prompt` |
| `gx copy-commands` | `gx prompt --exec` |
| `gx print-agents-snippet` | `gx prompt --snippet` |
| `gx review` | `gx agents start` |

---

## `09` &nbsp;Known rough edges

Being honest about where this still has issues:

- **Usage limit mid-task.** When an agent hits its Codex / Claude usage
  limit partway through, another agent may need to take over the same
  sandbox and run the remaining finish / cleanup steps.
- **Conflict-stuck probes.** Fixed in v7.0.2 — earlier versions could
  leak `__source-probe-*` worktrees when the sync-guard rebase hit
  conflicts.
- **Windows.** Most of the hook surface assumes a POSIX shell. Use WSL
  or symlink-enabled git.

---

## `10` &nbsp;Companion tools

All optional — but if you're running many agents, you probably want them.
`gx status` auto-detects each one and reports it in the `Global services`
block.
