## Multi-Agent Execution Contract (multiagent-safety)

0. Session plan comment + read gate (required)

- Before editing, each agent must post a short session comment/handoff note that includes:
  - plan/change name (or checkpoint id),
  - owned files/scope,
  - intended action.
- Before deleting/replacing code, each agent must read the latest session comments/handoffs first and confirm the target code is in their owned scope.
- If ownership is unclear or overlaps, stop that edit, post a blocker comment, and let the leader/integrator reassign scope.
- For git isolation, each agent must start on a dedicated branch via `scripts/agent-branch-start.sh "<task-or-plan>" "<agent-name>"`.
- In-place branch mode is disallowed: never switch the active local/base checkout to an agent branch.
- Treat the base branch (`main` or the user's current local base branch) as read-only while the agent branch is active.
- Agent completion defaults to `scripts/codex-agent.sh`, which auto-finishes the branch (auto-commit changed files, push/create PR, attempt merge, and pull the local base branch after merge).
- Auto-finish now waits for required checks/merge and then cleans merged sandbox branch/worktree by default.
- Use `--no-cleanup` only when you explicitly need to keep a merged sandbox for audit/debug follow-up.
- If codex-agent auto-finish cannot complete, immediately run `scripts/agent-branch-finish.sh --branch "<agent-branch>" --via-pr --wait-for-merge` and keep the branch open until checks/review pass.
- If merge/rebase conflicts block auto-finish, run a conflict-resolution review pass in that sandbox branch, then rerun `agent-branch-finish.sh --via-pr` until merged.
- Completion is not valid until these are true: commit exists on the agent branch, branch is pushed to `origin`, and PR/merge status is produced by `agent-branch-finish.sh` or `codex-agent`.
- For every new task, if an assigned agent sub-branch/worktree is already open, continue in that sub-branch; otherwise create a fresh one from the current local base snapshot with `scripts/agent-branch-start.sh`.
- Never implement directly on the local/base branch checkout; keep it unchanged and perform all edits in the agent sub-branch/worktree.
- If the change publishes or bumps a version, the same change must also update release notes/changelog entries.

1. Explicit ownership before edits

- Assign each agent clear file/module ownership.
- Do not edit files outside your assigned scope unless the leader reassigns ownership.

2. Preserve parallel safety

- Assume other agents are editing nearby code concurrently.
- Never revert unrelated changes authored by others.
- If another change conflicts with your approach, adapt and report the conflict in handoff.

3. Verify before completion

- Run required local checks for the area you changed.
- Do not mark work complete without command output evidence.

4. Required handoff format (every agent)

- Files changed
- Behavior touched
- Verification commands + results
- Risks / follow-ups

## OpenSpec Plan Workspace (recommended)

When work needs a durable planning phase, scaffold a plan workspace before implementation:

```bash
bash scripts/openspec/init-plan-workspace.sh "<plan-slug>"
```

Expected shape:

```text
openspec/plan/<plan-slug>/
  summary.md
  checkpoints.md
  planner/plan.md
  planner/tasks.md
  architect/tasks.md
  critic/tasks.md
  executor/tasks.md
  writer/tasks.md
  verifier/tasks.md
```
