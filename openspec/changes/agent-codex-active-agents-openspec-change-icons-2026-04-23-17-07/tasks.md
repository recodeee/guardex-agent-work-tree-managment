Handoff: 2026-04-23 codex owns branch `agent/codex/active-agents-openspec-change-icons-2026-04-23-17-07`, the Active Agents live/template unassigned-change icon rule, focused tests, and this OpenSpec change for distinct `spec.md` / `proposal.md` / `tasks.md` visuals in changed rows.

## 1. Specification

- [x] 1.1 Finalize proposal scope for semantic OpenSpec icons in changed Active Agents rows.
- [x] 1.2 Define normative requirements in `specs/vscode-active-agents-provider-icons/spec.md`.

## 2. Implementation

- [x] 2.1 Limit generic warning icons to real lock/protected-branch risk instead of delta-only rows.
- [x] 2.2 Keep the live/template extension sources mirrored.
- [x] 2.3 Add focused regression coverage for delta-only unassigned `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and `spec.md` nodes.

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Run `node --test test/vscode-active-agents-session-state.test.js`. Passed on `2026-04-23` (`52/52` tests passed).
- [x] 3.2 Run `openspec validate agent-codex-active-agents-openspec-change-icons-2026-04-23-17-07 --type change --strict`. Result: `Change 'agent-codex-active-agents-openspec-change-icons-2026-04-23-17-07' is valid`.
- [x] 3.3 Run `openspec validate --specs`. Result: `No items found to validate.`

## 4. Cleanup (mandatory; run before claiming completion)

- [ ] 4.1 Run `gx branch finish --branch "agent/codex/active-agents-openspec-change-icons-2026-04-23-17-07" --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`.
- [ ] 4.2 Record the PR URL and final `MERGED` state in the completion handoff.
- [ ] 4.3 Confirm the sandbox worktree and branch refs are gone after cleanup.

BLOCKED: none.
