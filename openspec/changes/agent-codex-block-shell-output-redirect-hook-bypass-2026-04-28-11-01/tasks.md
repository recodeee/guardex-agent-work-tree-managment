## Definition of Done

This change is complete only when **all** of the following are true:

- Every checkbox below is checked.
- The agent branch reaches `MERGED` state on `origin` and the PR URL + state are recorded in the completion handoff.
- If any step blocks (test failure, conflict, ambiguous result), append a `BLOCKED:` line under section 4 explaining the blocker and **STOP**. Do not tick remaining cleanup boxes; do not silently skip the cleanup pipeline.

## Handoff

- Handoff: change=`agent-codex-block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01`; branch=`agent/codex/block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01`; scope=`TODO`; action=`continue this sandbox or finish cleanup after a usage-limit/manual takeover`.
- Copy prompt: Continue `agent-codex-block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01` on branch `agent/codex/block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01`. Work inside the existing sandbox, review `openspec/changes/agent-codex-block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01/tasks.md`, continue from the current state instead of creating a new sandbox, and when the work is done run `gx branch finish --branch agent/codex/block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01 --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`.

## 1. Specification

- [x] 1.1 Finalize proposal scope and acceptance criteria for `agent-codex-block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01`.
- [x] 1.2 Define normative requirements in `specs/hook-guardrails/spec.md`.

## 2. Implementation

- [x] 2.1 Implement scoped behavior changes.
- [x] 2.2 Add/update focused regression coverage.

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Run targeted project verification commands. Evidence: `python3 -m py_compile .codex/hooks/skill_guard.py .claude/hooks/skill_guard.py`; `node --test --test-name-pattern "repo hook settings reference real local hook directories|repo skill guard blocks shell output redirect bypasses" test/setup.test.js` -> 2 passed.
- [x] 3.2 Run `openspec validate agent-codex-block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01 --type change --strict`. Evidence: valid.
- [x] 3.3 Run `openspec validate --specs`. Evidence: no spec items found.

## 4. Cleanup (mandatory; run before claiming completion)

- [ ] 4.1 Run the cleanup pipeline: `gx branch finish --branch agent/codex/block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01 --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`. This handles commit -> push -> PR create -> merge wait -> worktree prune in one invocation.
  - BLOCKED: `gx branch finish --branch agent/codex/block-shell-output-redirect-hook-bypass-2026-04-28-11-01 --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup` needs network approval, but escalation was rejected because the account hit the usage limit until 3:40 PM. Next step: rerun the same finish command after approval quota resets.
- [ ] 4.2 Record the PR URL and final merge state (`MERGED`) in the completion handoff.
- [ ] 4.3 Confirm the sandbox worktree is gone (`git worktree list` no longer shows the agent path; `git branch -a` shows no surviving local/remote refs for the branch).
